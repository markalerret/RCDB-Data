# RCDB-Data
Description:
This project aims to build dataset pulled from rcdb.com.  The dataset will include all roller coasters in the USA, and several key metrics (height, drop, track type etc).

Once the dataset is created and posted, exploratory data analysis will be performed on the dataset, to build knowledge of the dataset in preparation of more extensive data science.

Once EDA is complete, I will select and pursue other data analysis and data science projects on the dataset.
