# RCDB-Data
Description:
This project aims to build dataset pulled from rcdb.com.  The dataset will include all roller coasters in the USA, and several key metrics (height, drop, track type etc)./n
Once the dataset is created and posted, exploratory data analysis will be performed on the dataset, to build knowledge of the dataset in preparation of more extensive data science./n
Once EDA is complete, I will select and pursue other data analysis and data science projects on the dataset.
